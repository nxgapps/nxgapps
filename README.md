# NX GApps Project

Information
------------------

These are Google Apps for those who want to install Google Packages on a custom rom.
Remember Apks and Jars files are prebuilt from Google.
All closed source files come from Nexus's factory images.
This contains just the core files needed to setup a fully working Google account,
users will choose which apps they want on their devices.
GApps contain a "quite old" universal Play Service, so the Play Store will download the proper one
for your device asap.
These GApps get monthly updates, feel free to fork and contribute to this, but remember,
**Opensource does not mean out-of-respect**.
Also **NO MIRRORS ALLOWED**
